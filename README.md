## What is WebGL?

'Web Graphics Library is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D and 2D graphics whitin any compatible Web browser without the use of plug-ins. It consists of control code written in JavaScript and special effects code (shader code) that is executed on a computer's Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). WebGL elements can be mixed with other HTML elements and composited with other parts of the page or page background.' - Source: MDL documentation.

A shader is a program written in GLSL which takes information about the vertices that make up a shape and generates the data needed to render the pixels onto the screen: namely, the positions of the pixels and their colors.
